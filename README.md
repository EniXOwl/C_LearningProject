# My C Learning Project

This is a learning project for c programming and Makefiles.

## Structure

- `src/` - Source code
- `bin/` - Complied binaries
- `Makefile` - Build instructions

## How to use

```bash
make hello      # Compiles src/hello.c -> bin/hello
./bin/hello     # Runs the program
make clean      # Cleans compiled files
